# M.Eng-Project

Aug 2016 - May 2017
Data Analysis and Optimization Project with a major wine distributor in California, USA

Objective: 
  1. Mine and analyze a climiate dataset with 6 million records to verify data accuracy/quality and indentify patterns and correlations among data points using SQL and python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib)
  2. Apply machine learning algorithms - both supervised and unsupervised - to build a predictive model that estimates the total expected tonnage of each grape varietal across different growing regions
  3. Utilize the forecast model to optimize capacity management and reduce economic losses due to over-ripening
